        <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the online visibility of a website
            or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic",
            or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page),
            and more frequently a website appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive
            from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers.</p>

        <p>SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search,
            news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine
            optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web
            pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products
            or services. The former instead is more focused on national or international searches.</p>

        <h2>Search engine optimization</h2>
        <p>As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer programmed
            algorithms which dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms
            or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted
            audience.</p>
        <p>Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, adding content, doing HTML,
            and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers
            to the indexing activities of search engines.</p>
        <p>Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.
            By May 2015, mobile search had surpassed desktop search.[3] In 2015, it was reported that Google
            is developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products.</p>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="description of image" />
        <p>In response, many brands are beginning to take a different approach to their Internet marketing
            strategies.</p>
        <h3>Lorem ipsum dolor sit</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s,
                as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters needed
                only to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines which would send a "spider"
                to "crawl" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found
                testing on the page to be indexed.[5] The process involves a search engine spider downloading
                a page and storing it on the search engine's own server. A second program, known as an indexer,
                extracts information about the page, such as the words it contains, where they are located,
                and any weight for specific words, as well as all links the page contains.<p>
            <p>All of this information is then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date. </p>

        <h3>Website optimisation and testing</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Website owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,
                creating an opportunity for both white hat and black hat SEO practitioners. According
                to industry analyst Danny Sullivan, the phrase "search engine optimization" probably came
                into use in 1997.</p>
            <p>Sullivan credits Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.
                On May 2, 2007, Jason Gambert attempted to trademark the term SEO by convincing the Trademark
                Office in Arizona[9] that SEO is a "process" involving manipulation of keywords and not a
                "marketing service." </p>
